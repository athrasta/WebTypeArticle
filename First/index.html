Cocked on her head like a dark halo, Bonnie Parker wears a black beret. 
She’s holding a shotgun, and mock reaching for a pistol from her lover Clyde 
Barrow’s belt. On April 13th, 1933, Texas police officers raided a garage 
apartment, looking for bootleggers. Instead, they ran into Bonnie and Clyde’s 
outlaw gang. After a gunfight and the gang’s escape, the police found an 
undeveloped roll of film. In another shot from this roll, Bonnie leans 
with her arm and leg against their stolen car, pistol in hand, smoking 
a cigar. These photos would grace the front page of every newspaper in 
the country, elevating the couple&mdash;and Bonnie’s beret&mdash;to celebrity status 
in the brief period before their violent end.</p>

In the 1967 film version of the bank robbing couple’s life, 
Faye Dunaway wears a beret throughout, pairing it with all manner 
of blazers, knits, patterns, bandannas, and firearms. The looks are 
instantly recognizable, and would be replicated in hundreds of fashion 
editorials over the 70s, 80s, and 90s, alongside aggressively marketed 
visions of aspirational French style. Generations of ads told American 
women: wear a beret to attain that coveted French ease—a version of 
beauty couched in contradictory equal parts of laziness, thinness, 
perfection, attention, mystery, and je ne sais quoi.</p>
<p>
Even now, berets are seen on the runways of Lemaire, Chanel, and 
Gucci, channeling the aspirational aloof of French fashion. A beret 
has no natural styling, no set outfit for which they are the prime 
accessory. Symbolically loose, they can be successfully paired with 
suits and t-shirts, greyscales or pastels, patterns or solids. 
Pulled back on the head, they feel relaxed. Pulled forward, militant. 
The beret is so amorphous, so all-purpose, any universal theory of the 
hat would be insufficient, involving a stretch in logic too cute or 
crude to hold any wisdom. The hat speaks for nothing but its epidemiology, 
how easily a symbol can spread, be reappropriated, taken and used in a new way.</p>

Harry Styles wears a blue “Ladies Who Lunch” feathered-and-veiled Margiela 
beret in a shoot by Ryan McGinley for Rolling Stone. Ingrid Bergman wears a 
beret in the flashback to Paris life in Casablanca, Marilyn Monroe wears 
one in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Alicia Silverstone wears several as 
Cher Horowitz in Clueless, Cardi B poses in West Hollywood in October, 
wearing a caramel leather autumnal take. Janet Jackson, Julia Roberts, 
Tyra Banks&mdash;the beret was the hallmark of the 90s it-girl. The hat had 
its blockbuster moment in 1998 when it graced every tabloid and mainstream 
media cover: Monica Lewinsky wears a black beret with a silver bow on the 
side, hugging Bill Clinton. These events might have sentenced the garment to 
Halloween costume status, but the beret cannot be defined by a singular 
person or act. It persists.</p>

<p>
The beret is simultaneously the hat of the old European, the artist, 
the hipster, the outlaw, the revolutionary, the soldier. It is a fashion 
symbol of both empire and rebellion. It can be tailored in a spirit of 
bohemian creativity or militant politics with a simple change of color, 
lining, or orientation. The black beret formation that flanked Beyoncé 
during her 2016 Superbowl performance is the same black beret that Huey 
Newton and the Black Panthers wore with fists in the air. The standard 
dress headgear for US soldiers is the same beret that graced the crown of 
Lauren Bacall and Brigitte Bardot. The same beret Emily Ratajkowski now 
posts to Instagram with the caption “Beret-ed” is, somehow, the same hat 
that belonged to Wagner, to Picasso, to Hemingway.</p>

They can be made uniform, identical to one another, lending themselves 
naturally to trend. At least 102 countries include a beret as part of 
their military uniform. They are worn by the Royal Tank Regiment of the 
United Kingdom, the Paratroopers Brigade Folgore of Italy, and the 
Indian Army. The headgear is so intertwined with military force that 
United States Army Special Forces are simply referred to as “Green Berets,” 
with many never knowing their official name. A full list of military units 
that wear berets would take up this entire space. Kangol, which would become 
a fixture of 90s hip-hop headwear, was the primary supplier of berets for the 
British military during World War II.</p>
<p>
The hat is a time-traveller. The silhouette, the general construction of 
it, has been around for millennia. Variants stretched from Scotland to 
Greece, sewing their DNA into national identities, uniforms, and tribal 
costume. The modern beret originally hails from Basque Country, the headgear of 
shepherds working in Pyrenees valleys. It then became a factory-produced 
item in Southern France, exported in every direction. In American and 
British depictions of the French, it became the cliché, a caricatured 
outfit to be summoned whenever a cartoon deemed it necessary. It’s the 
cheapest way to suggest an idealized version of French femininity, or 
someone confident and worldly enough to invoke it.</p>
<p>
I remember finding a photo of Dizzy Gillespie as a record-obsessed 
teenager, his beret over glasses over smile over suit over trumpet in 
hand, marveling at the next frame of his cheeks exploding with power and 
force and poetry. I remember the cool girls in 90s Delia’s ads wearing 
them with colored knit scarves, hovering on the sides of their hair like 
magic. Or the movie stars and models of the era—Winona Ryder looking 
small-headed and easy, Kate Moss shot in the street, wearing baggy 
clothes, holding a puppy, a laundry line strung up behind her. With a 
strangely similar aura, Rembrandt posed in one for his self-portrait at 
a time when many Dutch painters depicted peasants in their day-to-day 
life wearing berets.</p>
<p>
Several friends of mine referred to berets as having a “high degree of 
difficulty” to pull off, but I think that might be wrong. It’s a matter 
of tilt, and more importantly, of intent. The most authentic beret 
wearers might be those on the margins, those who experiment, those 
can—despite the hat’s manifold history—claim it as their own.</p>
